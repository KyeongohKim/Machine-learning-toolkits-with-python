## Hyperparmeter tuning (Grid search vs. Random search)

- Grid search & random search with Scikit-learn
- "Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time." (Bergstra and Bengio 2012)

## Model selection (Bootstrap vs. Cross-validation)

- Bootstrap & cross-validation with Scikit-learn
- "Our results indicate that for real-world datasets similar to ours, the best method to use for model selection is ten-fold stratified cross validation, even if computation power allows using more folds
